ksfx is a simple menu bar application that plays the DJ Airhorn sound effect
whenever a key is pressed.

## Context

Some colleagues were discussing whether or not it's appropriate to use clicky
switches in the office. I suggested writing an app that plays the DJ Airhorn on
key presses to flex on the choc white afficionados. Under normal
circumstances, I would have left it at that, but vibe-coding makes cranking out
meme projects a breeze so here we are.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/droctothorpe/ksfx.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd ksfx
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

5. Press any key to hear the airhorn sound.
6. To disable the airhorn, either stop the script or click the ksfx icon (၊၊||၊)
   in the menu bar and select `Off`.


## Notes

- You may need to grant accessibility permissions to your terminal or Python application.

## TODO

- Provide mechanism that lets users select their own sound effect files.
- Convert into a proper Python package.
